## The Sponge Loop

Sponges (Porifera) in particular, are able to significantly affect seawater biogeochemistry via the so-called ‘Sponge Loop’. In this process, dissolved organic matter (DOM) is recycled within the sponge, and made available to the surrounding organisms as particulate organic matter (POM), thus fertilizing local communities (Figure 4.1). Considering that DOM molecules are not profitable to most marine organisms, such recycling process allows DOM to re-enter in higher trophic levels, avoiding energy losses to the open ocean. Therefore, the study of filter feeders’ activity is essential and timely to estimate the status of our oceans, and to understand how these systems function.
