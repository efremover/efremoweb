## High-throughput purification of PCR amplicons using paramagnetic beads

1) Add paramagnetic beads to your PCR sample
2) The paramagnetic beads bind selectively to DNA fragments of 100bp and larger
3) The paramagnetic beads and bound DNA are separated from the excess reactives by placing the tube into a magnetic rack
4) Excess primers, nucleotides, salts, and enzymes are removed and the magnetic pellet is washed carefully with 70% Ethanol
5) Ethanol is evaporated inside of the magnetic rack
6) DNA is eluted from the paramagnetic beads with H2O
7) The paramagnetic beads are separated from the aquatic DNA solution by again placing the tube into the magnetic rack
8) The purified DNA solution is transferred carefully into a new tube
