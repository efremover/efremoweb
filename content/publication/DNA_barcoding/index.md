abstract: DNA barcoding is a versatile approach that has revolutionized taxonomy and other akin topics in biology and ecology, due to its simplicity and relatively costless procedures. The method consists in the production of one or a few amplicons from informative genetic regions via Sanger sequencing. These markers are selected because they tend to evolve at a similar pace as speciation, allowing to discriminate organismal species. The applicability of this technique is here portrayed for the taxonomical identification of marine sponges (phylum Porifera) as an example.
