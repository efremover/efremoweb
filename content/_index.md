              I studied the microbial and metabolic dynamics of sponges under Ocean Acidification. I sampled two sponge species in a CO2 vent and a control site on Ischia Island (Italy) by scuba diving and then analyzed their microbial communities via Illumina Next-Generation-Sequencing. After conducting a NMR-based metabolomics workflow with OPLS-DA, I correlated microbiome and metabolome data. During an international collaboration with the Max-Planck-Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen (Germany), I developed a new underwater sampling method.

              During the BSc Nutritional Sciences I studied the basics of natural sciences, biomedicine, biochemistry and molecular biology, whereby I specialised in molecular nutrition. I conducted my bachelor thesis in the field of cell biology at the Center for Molecular Biomedicine (Jena) and an international collaboration with the computational department at the Benemerita-University of Puebla (Mexico), where I was able to acquire first experience in bioinformatic analyses. Aim of my thesis project was to reveal if vanilloid derivatives are possible inhibitors of the polo-like kinase 1, inducing cell-cycle arrest and reducing cancer cell activity. Final Grade 1.5 (A; distinction)
