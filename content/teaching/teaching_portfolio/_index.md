## Supervision

During my M.Sc. and PhD I co-supervised Bachelor and Master students, as well as interns, covering laboratory activities including analytical chemistry techniques and molecular biology. Main laboratory activities included the chemical extraction of marine invertebrates, Thin-Layer-Chromatography, HPLC, and sample preparation for NMR and LC-MS analyses. Molecular biology techniques included mainly PCR, purification of PCR products and genomic sequencing for metabarcoding. I further supported students in conducting microbiome data analyses, using the QIIME2 pipeline and R-studio.

## Laboratory Teaching Aid Role - Biochemistry Internship

Friedrich Schiller University - 2016. I was a teaching aid for experimental labs during this advanced course of biochemistry for nutrition scientists. I chiefly led an biochemistry lab concerning amino acid analyses with TLC and ELISA to detect and quantify specific proteins .

## Musical Pedagogical Experience

In 2015 - 2019 I worked as a violin teacher for children in the age of 10 up to 15. In 2012 - 2013 I supported the early musical education at the Musikschule Altenkunstadt (Germany) for children in the age of 5 up to 8.
