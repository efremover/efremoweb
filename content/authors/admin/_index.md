I am a PhD student researching the impact of ocean acidification, a mainly anthropogenic driven environmental stressors, on marine ecosystem stabilities at the Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn. In particular, I am analyzing the microbiome composition and chemical ecology of marine sponges and their impact on nutritional cycles. My research interests include microbiomics, metabolomics, chemical ecology, biochemistry and nutrition. My academic specialisation is focused on nutritional sciences and biochemistry, however my current PhD position allowed me an interdisciplinary integration of my knowledge and a contribution to Climate Change research. I successfully defended my PhD thesis in my viva examination and I am currently searching a PostDoc position, a research management role or a lecturing position in related scientific fields.
