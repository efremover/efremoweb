Ocean acidification (OA) represents a threat to marine ecosystems, and benthic organisms must develop adaptive strategies. Marine sponges are often forecasted as winner taxa, yet, we lack holistic understanding of stress tolerance and positive acclimatization. Sponges can be categorized into high and low microbial abundance (HMA and LMA) species, which may adopt divergent strategies to maintain homeostasis and fitness under changing conditions. 
The HMA sponge Chondrosia reniformis and the LMA sponge Spirastrella cunctatrix were collected from a natural CO2 vent system and a control pH site (Ischia, Italy). Adaptive traits were investigated by comparing microbial and metabolic shifts in sponge holobionts. Microbial diversity and core microbiomes changed for both species in response to OA. Morphologically, S. cunctatrix showed tissue necrosis, accompanied by reduced oscula and water canal sizes. The LMA sponge showed signs of stress-induced dysbiosis and microbial instability, whereas C. reniformis seemed to profit from a highly diverse microbiome with functional redundancy and local microbiome stability, promoting acclimatization to OA. NMR based metabolomics revealed stable metabolite profiles across sites for C. reniformis, suggesting metabolic homeostasis. Instead, metabolic shifts in S. cunctatrix suggested that OA could be interfering in several pathways, including osmoregulation, and energy metabolism.
To expand within organismal acclimatization processes towards biochemical exchanges with the environment, a new in situ sampling methodology was developed. The study of inhaled and exhaled water fluxes of filter-feeders was improved using a submarine peristaltic pump and applied on C. reniformis. The new methodology can be applied for variety of ecology research topics, such as nutrient cycling, filter-feeding fluxes, plankton dynamics and seawater metabolomics.
In this PhD project, diverse OA acclimatization strategies of two Porifera species co-occurring in a CO2 vent system are compared, based on microbiome and metabolic patterns. Further, parallel studies of biochemical exchanges with seawater are key to reconstruct these adaptation mechanisms.
